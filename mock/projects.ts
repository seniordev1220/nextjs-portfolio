The website was designed using MUI, a library of pre-built React components that follow Material Design principles, resulting in a sleek and professional design. To handle state management and asynchronous actions, I integrated Redux and Saga. This allowed for efficient state management and smooth user interactions, resulting in a faster and more seamless user experience. The website showcases my skills, experience, and projects, and is an excellent representation of my abilities as a web developer.",

    content: `<h3>Introduction</h3>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Collaborating with a renowned Japanese fashion retail giant, I held a pivotal role in two crucial proof-of-concept (POC) projects. The first project aimed to revolutionize error handling processes within their application, which consisted of over 50 different microservices. Previously, the client relied on Google Sheets for documenting error scenarios. To streamline this process and enhance efficiency, I single-handedly developed a comprehensive and user-friendly error handling documentation tool. The second project involved creating an endpoint diagramming tool to visually represent API calls within the application, providing valuable insights into its complex interactions.</p>

<h3>My roles and responsibilities encompassed:</h3>

<p><strong>Error Handling Documentation Tool:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Conceptualizing, designing, and implementing a streamlined error handling documentation tool to replace the previous reliance on Google Sheets.</li>
  <li>Integrating the tool seamlessly with the existing infrastructure, significantly reducing the time and effort required to identify and track customer-reported issues.</li>
  <li>Collaborating closely with customer service teams, operations teams, and product managers to ensure seamless collaboration and efficient problem-solving processes.</li>
  <li>Empowering root cause analysis by implementing a systematic approach to identify and address customer-reported issues.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Endpoint Diagramming Tool:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating a proof-of-concept endpoint diagramming tool that visually represented API calls between the Single Page Application (SPA), Backend for Frontend (BFF), and other microservices.</li>
  <li>Enhancing troubleshooting capabilities by providing developers and operations teams with a comprehensive visualization of the application&apos;s API communication.</li>
  <li>Ensuring scalability and flexibility by designing the tool to adapt to evolving microservice architectures and facilitate future development and maintenance.</li>

        <p>My backend is built using Node.js, a powerful and widely-used JavaScript runtime environment, and Express.js, a popular Node.js framework that allows me to easily manage routes, handle incoming requests, and send responses back to the client.</p>
      
        <h4>PostgreSQL Database</h4>
        <p>I've also integrated a PostgreSQL database into my backend, which allows me to store and retrieve data for my site's users, projects, and blog posts. What's more, the database is present in the same Docker container as my backend, making it even easier to manage and deploy the application. For local development, I use PGWeb, which is also installed inside the container.</p>
      
        <h4>Docker Containerization</h4>
