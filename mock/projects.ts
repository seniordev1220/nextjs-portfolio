      "A modern and responsive portfolio website using Next.js, MUI, Redux, and Saga. With Next.js, I was able to leverage server-side rendering and static site generation for improved performance and faster load times. The website was designed using MUI, a library of pre-built React components that follow Material Design principles, resulting in a sleek and professional design. To handle state management and asynchronous actions, I integrated Redux and Saga. This allowed for efficient state management and smooth user interactions, resulting in a faster and more seamless user experience. The website showcases my skills, experience, and projects, and is an excellent representation of my abilities as a web developer.",

    content: ` <p>My Exciting Portfolio website is a Single Page Application (SPA) that's designed to showcase my work and make it easy for visitors to navigate and explore my content. Here are some of the features that you can expect to find on my site:</p>

        <h4>Admin Routes</h4>
        <p>I've included a secure login system that allows me to manage my site's content, including my blog posts and project listings. This means that I can easily add, edit, or delete content as needed, all while ensuring that my visitors only see the most up-to-date and accurate information.</p>
      
        <h4>Email Sending with SendGrid</h4>
        <p>I've integrated SendGrid into my site, which allows visitors to easily get in touch with me by filling out a quick and easy contact form. This ensures that I never miss an important message or opportunity, and that visitors can get the help and support they need as quickly as possible.</p>
      
        <h4>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</h4>
        <p>I've used Next.js to build my site, which allows for server-side rendering of my blog and project pages. This means that visitors will experience faster page loads and better search engine optimization (SEO) for my content, which can help drive more traffic to my site and increase engagement.</p>
      
        <h4>My Tech Stack</h4>
        <p>To build my site, I used a combination of powerful technologies and frameworks, including:</p>
      
        <ul>
          <li>Next.js for building a fast, modern, and scalable SPA</li>
          <li>Redux and Redux Saga for state management and side effects</li>
          <li>Material UI (MUI) for building beautiful and responsive UI components</li>
          <li>SASS for styling and theming my site</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>Each of these tools played a critical role in helping me build a site that's fast, reliable, and easy to use. Together, they create a seamless user experience that visitors are sure to love!</p>
        <h4>Deployment on Vercel</h4>
        <p>I deployed my site on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. This allowed me to easily deploy and manage my site without worrying about server management, scaling, or performance. With Vercel, my site is fast, reliable, and always up-to-date.</p>
        <h4>My Domain Name</h4>
        <p>I've also purchased a custom domain name for my site: akmj.social. I registered this domain with GoDaddy, which allowed me to easily manage my domain registration, DNS settings, and other important details. This makes it easy for visitors to remember my site and find me online!</p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting My Exciting Portfolio SPA. I hope you enjoy exploring my work, and if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to use the contact form to get in touch with me!</p>

      "My portfolio website's backend application was built using Node.js and Express.js for server-side functionality, and PostgreSQL as the database management system to store and retrieve data. I also used Docker for containerization, which helped to simplify the deployment process. The application is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which ensures reliability, scalability, and high availability. Overall, the backend application provides a robust and scalable architecture for handling the data and functionality of my portfolio website.",

    content: ` <p>This Express.js application serves as the backend for my Exciting Portfolio SPA, providing the necessary server-side functionality and database access to make my site run smoothly. Here are some of the key features that you can expect to find in my backend:</p>

        <h4>Node.js and Express.js</h4>
        <p>My backend is built using Node.js, a powerful and widely-used JavaScript runtime environment, and Express.js, a popular Node.js framework that allows me to easily manage routes, handle incoming requests, and send responses back to the client.</p>
      
        <h4>PostgreSQL Database</h4>
        <p>I've also integrated a PostgreSQL database into my backend, which allows me to store and retrieve data for my site's users, projects, and blog posts. What's more, the database is present in the same Docker container as my backend, making it even easier to manage and deploy the application. For local development, I use PGWeb, which is also installed inside the container.</p>
      
        <h4>Docker Containerization</h4>
        <p>To make my backend even more efficient and scalable, I've containerized it using Docker. This allows me to easily deploy and manage my application on a variety of different platforms and environments, while ensuring that everything stays secure and isolated from other applications.</p>
      
        <h4>Deployment on Heroku and AWS</h4>
        <p>I initially deployed my backend on Heroku's free tier, which allowed me to easily deploy, manage, and scale my application without worrying about server management or configuration. However, when the free tier was no longer available, I moved my application to AWS's free tier, which provides similar benefits and features for free.</p>
